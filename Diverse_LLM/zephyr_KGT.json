In vivo breast cancer studies have shown that fulvestrant can delay the establishment of MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice. Fulvestrant can inhibit the growth of MCF-7 xenografts and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer xenografts. In preclinical studies in immature or ovariectomized rats and monkeys, fulvestrant did not show a dose-dependent effect. In preclinical studies in immature rats and ovariectomized monkeys, fulvestrant inhibited estrogen-induced growth. Treatment with fulvestrant did not affect FSH and LH levels in the blood of postmenopausal women, indicating no effect on peripheral hormones."
